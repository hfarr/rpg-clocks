     the right side will "turn" at the angle specified. So the goal is to cover the angular
     distance between the right edge of one square nad the left edge of the next square.
     We know the total angle between the two "left" edges is 360 / n, where n is number of 
     segments, and we are already 90degrees of the way there because these are rectangular
     divs. so the remaining distance to skew by is the full distance minus the distance
     already covered.
     Skew isn't precisely covered by my comment here, but that "right edge moves by
     the angle" bit is a side effect that accomplishes what we need*/
